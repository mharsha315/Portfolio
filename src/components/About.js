            Hey there, I'm Harshavardhana Mudduluru, an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about turning data into meaningful insights. 
            Although Iâ€™m just starting out, my curiosity and determination drive me to constantly learn and grow in the field of analytics.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not crunching numbers, I enjoy exploring new data sets, working on personal projects, and sharing my knowledge with the data community. 
            I'm always eager to learn more and contribute to meaningful projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the data world, you can find me hiking, watching anime, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
